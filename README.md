# 🎭 FaceTunes  
> AI-powered Facial Expression Recognition App

FaceTunes is a deep learning project that detects human faces from images or live video and classifies their emotions into seven categories. It's built using **TensorFlow**, **OpenCV**, and **Flask**, and trained on the [Face Expression Recognition Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/jonathanoheix/face-expression-recognition-dataset).
